## Everyone can contribute
DataCite is an open core product and has over 3000 community contributors. When everyone can contribute, consumers become contributors and we greatly increase the rate of human progress.

To ensure that everyone can contribute to DataCite with confidence we provide everyone with the right resources and know-how. The Undercoat design system is the single source of truth for everything anyone needs to know about contributing to DataCite.


## Everything you need
**Undercoat** is here to make it as comfortable as possible for anyone to contribute towards DataCite. You will find information such as our principles, components, usage guidelines, branding, research methodologies, and more!

Start by looking into the component documentation, including live examples.
