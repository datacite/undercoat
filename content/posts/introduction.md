At Datacite, we are excited to announce the introduction of our new design system, Undercoat.

As an organization that values collaboration and innovation, we constantly look for ways to improve our processes and products. That is why we have developed Undercoat, a design system that will provide our teams with a consistent and user-friendly design language for our web services.

The undercoat is the part of a dog's coat that grows closest to its skin.
Inspired by the naming of our development team's code repositories (after dog breeds), Undercoat is a fitting name for our design system, as it represents the foundation and support for our application design look and feels. 

One of the key advantages of using a design system like Undercoat is the consistency it provides. By having a standardized set of design components and guidelines, our teams can create user interfaces that are cohesive and easy to use. This not only improves the user experience but also reduces the time and effort needed to design and develop new features and services.

In addition, Undercoat allows for flexibility and adaptability in our design work. With a modular approach to design, teams can easily customize and extend the design system to fit the specific needs of their projects, while still maintaining a consistent look and feel.

We are excited to see how Undercoat will improve the design and development process at DataCite, and we are confident that it will be a valuable addition to our toolset. 

We encourage any feedback and ideas towards the design system itself as well! If you are interested in contributing, check out our guidelines to get started. Have any questions? Open an issue on our Design System issue tracker. Otherwise, be sure to check out the Undercoat Toolkit.

One of the first places where you will see Undercoat in action will be on our homepage (datacite.org) so stay tuned for more updates on Undercoat and our continued efforts to improve and innovate at Datacite.
