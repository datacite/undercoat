{{< initial-letter paragraph="Welcome to DataCite's Design System where you will find all the components and guidelines for DataCite services' design language.

Our design system toolkit, which has the code name Undercoat, is used as a reference for building SSOT components but is not the SSOT itself.

The Components include a range of design elements, such as colors, typography, buttons, and forms, as well as more complex components such as navigation menus and data visualizations.

So take a look around, explore the Components of our design system, and see how it can help improve your design work. We are confident that you will find it to be a valuable tool in your design toolkit.


## Everything you need 
Undercoat is here to make it as comfortable as possible for anyone to contribute towards DataCite. You will find information such as our principles, components, usage guidelines, branding, research methodologies, and more!

Start by looking into the component documentation, including live examples.


## Contributing to the design system 
We encourage any feedback and ideas towards the design system itself as well! If you are interested in contributing, check out our guidelines to get started. Have any questions?
